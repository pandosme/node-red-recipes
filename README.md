# Node-RED Recipes for Axis Cameras

Welcome! This project is a curated library of practical **Node-RED flows (‚Äúrecipes‚Äù) designed specifically for Axis devices**. Whether you‚Äôre integrating, automating, or managing Axis devices‚Äîand even if you‚Äôre not a full-time developer‚Äîthese recipes will streamline your workflow.

**[Node-RED](https://nodered.org/)** is a user-friendly automation platform that makes working with Axis devices simple for engineers, integrators, and IT professionals. Each recipe below is ready for real-world use or as a starting point to adapt for your specific needs.
